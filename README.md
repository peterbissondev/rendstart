# rendstart
Client-Side Application In XML

The project of producing an client-side application has taken a turn from what looked like an experimental application in rotedevs to a fairly servious application with rendstart because what was a keyboard feature in C has evolved to loops in JavaScript.

Anyone, who has been around the industry and today, is retirement age, likely recall how routines worked from key press point of view, whereas now-a-days, it's a key clean process which is almost achievable through the client application I am working on.
