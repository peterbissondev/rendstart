# rendstart
Client-Side Application In XML

The project of producing a client-side application has taken a turn from what looked like an experimental application in rotedevs to a fairly serious application with rendstart because what was a keyboard feature in C has evolved to loops in JavaScript.

Anyone, who has been around the industry and today, is at retirement age, likely recall how routines worked from key press point of view, whereas now-a-days, it's a key clean process which is almost achievable through the client application I am working on.

Contenteditable="true", in JavaScript, is a very powerfull tool because the site I am developing is about always editable content, meaning there is no on and off edit switch, the site content is editable.

What I am working on with the site, is the idea that actions are interpretable, so there are no buttons to save text or file names required to save files, but rather JavaScript events and edit actions.

So maybe AI is interpretable. Intuitively, do I meeet AI, such as typing or a voice command with AI, yet just edting. AI must know where commands are not part of the content, which brings me to XML.

We have a history of looking at intpreters as programming language or technology interpretations, but a DTD applied at AI, well, that's a different machine.

What contenteditable does at the browser, so far rsearch with Edge, is render content editable with a spell checker, grammer (needs work), but also typing with voice. We can assume then, with features such as Mcirosoft's Visual Studio step forward and back features, AI can do the same, and that's where autosaving and file names are stored locally with the application I'm developing.

So now, client-side application developing, in XML, based on structuring book pages, what I am adding is the settings page(s), but this brings up a seprate issue about local saved pages and naming and always intuitive, as much as possible, because it works.
